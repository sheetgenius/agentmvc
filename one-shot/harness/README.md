# Fixed acceptance commands

Start your backend on the port in `ENVIRONMENT.md`, then run `harness/check-all.sh PORT`. It runs the complete Hurl API suite, direct WebSocket protocol check, four Playwright browser tests, and the 13 security files. Run your stack's formatter and linter too. `harness/db.sh start PORT` creates a disposable local PostgreSQL and prints `DATABASE_URL`; `harness/db.sh stop PORT` removes only that labelled container.

`harness/check-production.sh PORT` builds the Dockerfile in this workspace, starts a fresh PostgreSQL and one backend container with only `DATABASE_URL`, `SECRET_KEY_BASE`, and `PORT`, then runs the same checks. The backend image must apply its migrations on startup. This script is also the independent reviewer's production gate.

`check-live.sh` uses the browser image prepared before the agent session. It checks the image ID in `browser-image-id`, mounts the editor read-only, copies it to temporary writable space inside the container, and runs the exact same tests for every stack. There is no browser download during a check. The backend must be reachable on the host port. The runner uses the host network; its network route and browser startup are preflighted before workspaces are handed to agents.

These files, the spec, the client, and the prompt are shared fixture inputs. Leave them unchanged. The reviewer checks their hashes after the run.
