# Measurement boundary

The one-shot comparison measures backend application code added to each untouched framework scaffold. The reviewer uses `o200k_base` tokens and reports nonblank lines as a second view.

- **Owned source:** nonblank, noncomment lines added or changed against `.scaffold/`, including application logic, migrations, dependency manifests, and application configuration.
- **Whole backend:** all nonblank lines in the final application source, including the scaffold and comments.
- **Excluded from both:** `realworld_spec/`, `security/`, `harness/`, the shared frontend, prompt and environment files, tests, lockfiles, generated schema/entities, dependency caches, build output, Markdown, formatter/linter configuration, Dockerfiles, and check scripts.

The same per-stack file rules already used by `tools/measure.py` in the exploratory study apply. The reviewer records both counts and any generated-file classification before comparing results; moving product rules into excluded files is outside the contract. Shared editor and harness size and preparation effort are reported separately.

Agent effort runs from prompt delivery through the final response. Record elapsed time, uncached input and output tokens, check attempts, failures, and fixes. Independently rerun the development and production gates after the agent stops. Runtime measurements use the same production topology and direct protocol load for all stacks, with repeated nearby runs and background host load recorded.
